My name is Raduan Al-Shedivat, I am 23 year-old engineer and entrepreneur currently residing in [[Amsterdam, Netherlands]]. At the moment I work full-time as an engineer for [[Databricks]].\n\nI grew up in [[Moscow]] and studied Computer Science at the [[Higher School of Economics]].\nDuring my studies, I interned at [[Yandex]] and later worked for [[Celly.ai]]. There, I got some valuable software engineering experience and even tried to launch my own startup, [[Style Lab]], along with my friends from university. It didn't succeed, and since summer of 2021 I've relocated to [[Amsterdam, Netherlands]] to work for [[Databricks]].\n\nSince then I've been working at [[Databricks]], within the team, that is now called as Money Team â€“ we essentially make sure that the software business of Databricks is running smoothly and every customer is charged properly for every millisecond used on their cluster (with millions of clusters spawned daily). You can learn more about my contributions [[Databricks|here]].\n\nIn my spare time I am building [[main/projects|side-projects]], inlcuding my current project called [[Summate]]. We are building an AI that helps people make sense of the vast amount of content on the internet. Since January 2023, we have built several MVPs, and in April 2023, we are attending [[Nights \u0026 Weekends Season 3]] with the vision of creating a platform that allows people to connect any content (e.g., YouTube, Substack, LinkedIn, Telegram) and analyze it in the background. The AI would provide insights such as clusters of information, summaries, similarity checks, Q\u0026A on content, and more.\n\n### Where you can find me?\nToday I am being active on next list of platforms:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xRaduan)\n- [Telegram](https://t.me/notes_by_raduan)\n- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/0xRaduan)\n\nThis list will be updated over time to represent single source of truth for where you can find me.","lastmodified":"2023-04-08T16:31:02.349116053Z","tags":null},"/main/projects":{"title":"My Projects","content":"# My Projects\nThis page is under construction.
