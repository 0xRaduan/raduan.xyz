The main idea is simple:\n- there is too much content on the internet.\n- people spend countless hours \"catching-up\". \n- Why don't AI catch up for you and summarize all the content you are subscribed to?\n- That way you already have pre-requisite insights, so you can slice and dice the content you really need.\n\n\nProgress so far[[1](https://x.com/0xRaduan/status/1686409392475000832?s=20)]:\n- around 1300 users\n- latest landing and web-app has the slickest design I've ever built ;)\n\n### Past projects\n##### Style Lab\nBack in 2020 me and a 3 of my friends from university were building an AI fashion startup. Main idea was simple: upload your wardrobe to an app and start getting daily recommendations on what to wear.\n\nMajor learnings:\n- **Fail Fast**: Build quick \u0026 get feedback \u003e\u003e\u003e spend time overengineering and get zero feedback\n- **Learn from user interviews**: after 20 interviews with people and our friends, we didn't see much of an issue in figuring out what to wear, but still pursued into building it, instead of pivoting.\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-03T18:01:14.129015503Z","tags":null}}
