At the moment I work full-time as an engineer for [Databricks](https://databricks.com).\n\nI grew up in Moscow and studied Computer Science there. Did internships at big tech, continued my work in AI biotech startup â€“ [Celly.ai](https://celly.ai) and also in my own startup called [[Style Lab]].\n\nSince 2021 I moved to [[Amsterdam, Netherlands]] for work at [[Databricks]]. I've been mostly contributing to infrastructure here, making sure that the billion dollar business of [[Databricks]] runs smoothly when it comes to customer's money and how they are being charged.\n\nMy passion is building side projects, and I want to pursue one of them as a full-time business opportunity in the future. My current project is called [summate](https://summate.io), where me and 2 of my friends are building a platform to solve content overflow and provide useful tools to navigate massive amount of information for the 1 billion of knowledge workers. We started small â€“ from YouTube, and launched our free service for weekly summaries. \n\nI write about my journey building [summate](https://summate.io) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xRaduan).\n\n\n### Where you can find me?\nToday I am being active on next list of platforms:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xRaduan)\n- [Telegram](https://t.me/notes_by_raduan)\n- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/0xRaduan)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-29T18:32:19.705715979Z","tags":null},"/main/projects":{"title":"My Projects","content":"# My Projects\nThis page is under construction.
