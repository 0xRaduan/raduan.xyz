### Longer Version
My name is Raduan Al-Shedivat, I am 23 year-old engineer and entrepreneur currently residing in [[Amsterdam, Netherlands]]. At the moment I work full-time as an engineer for [Databricks](https://databricks.com).

I grew up in Moscow and studied Computer Science there. Did internships at big tech, continued my work in AI biotech startup – [Celly.ai](https://celly.ai) and also in my own startup called [[Style Lab]].

Since 2021 I moved to [[Amsterdam, Netherlands]] for work at [[Databricks]]. I've been mostly contributing to infrastructure here, making sure that the billion dollar business of [[Databricks]] runs smoothly when it comes to customer's money and how they are being charged.

My passion is building side projects, and I want to pursue one of them as a full-time business opportunity in the future. My current project is called [summate](https://summate.io), where me and 2 of my friends are building a platform to solve content overflow and provide useful tools to navigate massive amount of information for the 1 billion of knowledge workers. We started small – from YouTube, and launched our free service for weekly summaries. 

I write about my journey building [summate](https://summate.io) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xRaduan).
