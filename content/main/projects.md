### Current projects
Currently, I am working on https://summate.io alongside my long-time friend â€“ [Valeriy Klyukin](https://twitter.com/vklyukinc).

### Past projects
##### Style Lab
Back in 2020 me and a 3 of my friends from university were building an AI fashion startup. Main idea was simple: upload your wardrobe to an app and start getting daily recommendations on what to wear.

Major learnings:
- **Fail Fast**: Build quick & get feedback >>> spend time overengineering and get zero feedback
- **Learn from user interviews**: after 20 interviews with people and our friends, we didn't see much of an issue, but still pursued into building it.
