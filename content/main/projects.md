### Current projects
Currently, I am working on [summate.io](https://summate.io). The main idea is simple:
- there is too much content on the internet.
- people spend countless hours "catching-up". 
- Why don't AI catch up for you and summarize all the content you are subscribed to?
- That way you already have pre-requisite insights, so you can slice and dice the content you really need.


Progress so far[[1](https://x.com/0xRaduan/status/1686409392475000832?s=20)]:
- around 1300 users
- latest landing and web-app has the slickest design I've ever built ;)

### Past projects
##### Style Lab
Back in 2020 me and a 3 of my friends from university were building an AI fashion startup. Main idea was simple: upload your wardrobe to an app and start getting daily recommendations on what to wear.

Major learnings:
- **Fail Fast**: Build quick & get feedback >>> spend time overengineering and get zero feedback
- **Learn from user interviews**: after 20 interviews with people and our friends, we didn't see much of an issue in figuring out what to wear, but still pursued into building it, instead of pivoting.
